# Reactive LEDs
Giving LEDs the ability to dance!

## Overview
I am making and embedded system to sense environmental sounds and map its amplitude and frequency to the intensity and color of LEDs. Here is my initial plan for completing this project.

### Hardware Selection
1. Hardware Selection

### Board Familiarization
2. Stopwatch
3. HDMI Controller
4. Working With Servo Motors
5. VGA Display Controller
6. Audio Recorder and Player

### Board Development
7. ARM Processor Development
8. FPGA Development
9. FPGA and ARM Processor Integration

### System Benchmarking
10. System Benchmarking

### Upgrading the System
11. End Product Hardware Integration

I have selected the board, but am still doing research for the end product hardware, so I am working in both stages 1 and 2.
