# Reactive LEDs
Giving LEDs the ability to dance!

## Overview
I am making and embedded system to sense environmental sounds and map its amplitude and frequency to the intensity and color of LEDs. Here is my initial plan for completing this project.

### 1. Hardware Selection
- [Dev Board Selection](Hardware-Selection/Development-Boards.md)

### 2. Board Familiarization
- Stopwatch
- HDMI Controller
- Working With Servo Motors
- VGA Display Controller
- Audio Recorder and Player

### 3. Board Development
- ARM Processor Development
- FPGA Development
- FPGA and ARM Processor Integration

### 4. System Benchmarking
- System Benchmarking

### 5. Upgrading the System
- End Product Hardware Integration

## Current Stage
I have selected the board, but am still doing research for the end product hardware, so I am working in both stages 1 and 2.
