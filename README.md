# Reactive LEDs
Giving LEDs the ability to dance!

## Overview
I am making and embedded system to sense environmental sounds and map its amplitude and frequency to the intensity and color of LEDs. Here is my initial plan for completing this project.

1. Hardware Selection
2. Board Familiarization
3. ARM Processor Development
4. FPGA Development
5. FPGA and ARM Processor Integration
6. System Benchmarking
7. End Product Hardware Integration

I have selected the board, but am still doing research for the end product hardware, so I am working in both stages 1 and 2.
